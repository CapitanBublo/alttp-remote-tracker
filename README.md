# alttp-remote-tracker
WIP

This is a (WIP) remote tracker for TLoZ: A Link to the Past Randomizer

The main idea behind this project is to allow players of an ALttPR tournament to connect their games to a remote tracker, so that the tournament restream doesn't have to capture the players trackers or have people manually tracking.

This would allow, in theory, to also add extra features to the tracker, such as automatically playing animations for the items found, or a place to indicate the items missing for GO mode in the restream, without having the player do anything or get any information. (I say in theory because my knowledge on web programming at the moment is pretty low)

In the future, I'd like to make it possible for people to upload their own templates for the stream layout, so that this can be used by anyone.
